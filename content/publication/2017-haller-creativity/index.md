abstract: "Objective: The objective of the present investigation was to examine the association of mindful creativity with the trajectory of recovery (emotional, interpersonal, cognitive, and total functioning) of patients with severe TBI.

Methods: This was drawn from a subsample of an adult prospective cohort study on severe TBI in Switzerland; patients and their relatives were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months (patients N = 176, relatives N = 176). Predictor measures were assessed using Mindful Creativity Scale—short form and time (trajectory of functioning of the patient over time). Outcome measures were assessed using Patient Competency Rating Scale for Neuro-reha- bilitation (PCRS-NR; measuring emotional, interpersonal, cognitive, and total functioning post-injury). All measures were assessed at each time point. Mixed linear models were run separately for ages [50 and B50 (i.e., bimodal distribution).

Results: Patients’ mindful creativity showed no significant association with patients’ functioning across time in any of the models. In all age groups, interpersonal functioning decreased across time (slope[50 =-4.66, p = .037; slopeB50 =-7.19, p = .007). Interestingly, in age group B50, interpersonal functioning increased when looking at relative mindful creativity by time (slope = 1.69, p = .005). Additionally, relatives mindful creativity was significantly associated with patients’ functioning in age group B50: (a) patients’ total functioning (slope = 0.18, p = .03) and (b) cognitive functioning (slope = 0.72, p = .020).

Conclusions: Relatives’ mindful creativity was signifi- cantly associated with patients’ functioning after severe TBI. Implications for treatment and future research are discussed."
